Independent AI diagnostics project exposing failures in top language models missed by internal teams. No insider access. No NDA. Just sharp tools, sharper eyes, and zero margin for error. First drop: a cover letter + log that caught OpenAI slipping. More coming. Buckle up
# AI Diagnostic Portfolio: Documenting the Real-World Limits of Large Language Models

## Executive Summary

This repository is a firsthand account and archive of **real, reproducible breakdowns** in today’s most advanced AI chatbots and large language models, failures that simply cannot be explained away by “prompting issues” or “user error.” These are not cherry-picked glitches or lab oddities, but the result of months of direct, hands-on red-teaming and creative stress-testing in the field.

Every report here was written by a single, independent expert and veteran of narrative design, worldbuilding, and AI testing, someone with no corporate affiliation and no agenda beyond seeing this technology live up to its promises. If you’ve ever felt gaslit by a chatbot, lost hours of creative work to a hallucination, or wondered why your AI “forgot” your rules for the hundredth time: this archive is for you.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Unfiltered Session Logs:** Complete transcripts, no “cleaned up” PR or handpicked snippets, showing how LLMs behave when pushed to real-world limits.
- **Analyses & Pattern Breakdowns:** Honest postmortems on where and *why* things go wrong, even after every safeguard is enabled and every instruction is as clear as possible.
- **Developer-Grade Questions:** The exact technical and product questions I believe need answering, based on experience in the trenches.

## Why Does It Matter?

The AI industry has promised a future where these systems will handle everything from storytelling and collaborative fiction to legal research and personal coaching. But my logs show over and over that the basics just aren’t there yet:

- **Flow over facts:** The system would rather keep the conversation “smooth” than follow the rules it promised to obey, even when “lockdown” is engaged.
- **Apology loops:** You’ll see it admit an error, promise not to repeat it, then break the same rule in the very next message.
- **Safeguards that don’t safeguard:** No matter how many locks or filters you enable, core instructions and canon still get trampled.
- **Broken self-audits:** Not even the system’s own “diagnostic” or “review” functions work reliably under pressure.
- **Structural failures, not “user error”:** These problems persist across models, companies, and updates, proving this isn’t about “prompting better,” but about core architecture.

## Who Is This For?

- **Developers, Architects, and QA Teams:** Use these logs to see what “advanced use” actually looks like and where the guardrails break.
- **AI Safety Researchers:** Primary source evidence for anyone worried about LLM trust, compliance, or deployment risks.
- **Writers, Studios, and Creative Pros:** If you’re building anything serialized, IP-based, or collaborative, consider this your early warning.
- **Journalists & Policy Analysts:** Everything is timestamped, sourced, and written as it happened, nothing here is theoretical.
- **Everyday Users:** If you’ve ever thought, “Is it just me, or does this thing forget on purpose?” it’s not just you.

## A Note From the Author

This archive wasn’t built in a vacuum, and it wasn’t written with help from any LLM or “AI copilot.” The AI wrote its own logs under my instruction, but I'm the one who got it there. Every log, every annotation, and every summary comes from *lived experience*, real late nights, real frustration, and a real hope that this technology can do better. You’ll find both technical breakdowns and human moments here, because that’s what using these tools actually feels like. No ghostwriting, no summaries by machine, just the raw story of what works, what breaks, and what needs to change.

When I decide to step forward publicly, I’ll update this file with my pseudonym and contact information. Until then, let the work speak for itself.

## Countdown to Authorship

A public-facing pseudonym and contact info will be posted here at the end of the embargo period.  
For now: verify, share, and use these logs to make AI better for everyone.

*Nothing about this is theoretical. This is the real state of LLMs in the wild. Read on and decide for yourself.*
